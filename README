Soundly Sleeping is a remake of Ambient Nights, a school project. With a bit more free time on hand, I'm looking to add more features while cleaning up the old app.

The previous SoundlySleeping repo was deleted to condense the important files for onlookers. If you would like to try the app out, please reach out to me by email.

Soundly Sleeping is a simple white noise generator that helps with both falling asleep and waking up. Choose from unique themes such as "Tropical Jungle" and "Rushing River" to not only put you to sleep but wake you up!
- Choose nature sounds from various themes (3 on release)
- Different tracks play before you go to sleep and before you wake up to help set the mood
- Soothing tracks will lull you to sleep while exciting tracks get you ready for the day!

Currently it's only being tested on the HTC One (2013 model).
